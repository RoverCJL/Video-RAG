On the wall is a large screen displaying a digital map of a city and several smaller screens showing security camera footage. A man stands at the screen, pointing to the map.\n\nNext, the video shows several scenes of people working in an office environment. Some are sitting at desks on laptops, others are collaborating on a project on the floor, and others are sitting on steps in a common area.\n\nThe narrator explains that the Open Digital Platform (ODP) provides a trusted, open environment that lets creators plug and play easily to collaborate and contribute ideas.\n\nThe video then shows a digital twin of the JTC Summit, a virtual replica of the estate. The digital twin shows various areas of the building, including hallways, conference rooms, storage shelves, and staff cubicles. The narrator explains that simulations can take place in the virtual replica, guided by real-world data. This allows companies to test-bed solutions risk-free before taking them live.\n\nThe video then shows building managers getting full visibility over systems, enabling remote monitoring and control. A scene shows a person remotely directing a robot to a specific location in the building.\n\nLive feeds provide a direct view of what's happening on the ground, allowing managers to stay on top of events. The video shows a live feed of people moving through the building's lobby.\n\nHistorical data stored in the ODP can also be reviewed at a later time to resolve outstanding service issues. The video shows a screen displaying historical data on the building's HVAC system.\n\nSensors on the ground routinely transmit data to the ODP. The video shows a graphic of a sensor transmitting data.\n\nFinally, the video shows a group of people sitting around a table in a meeting room.

They are looking at laptops and other devices. On the wall behind them is a digital display showing the time, date, energy usage, temperature, and weather. The narrator explains that the platform can tap into these data sets for real-time analysis and response.\n\nNext, the video shows a close-up of the ceiling, focusing on the lighting fixtures. The narrator says that this allows systems to react preemptively to live events.\n\nThen, the video shows a digital display showing energy savings. The numbers on the display change, showing an increase in energy savings over time. The narrator explains that the system can sense and switch off devices no longer in use.\n\nThe video then shows a darkened conference room with a large screen displaying a message that a meeting is about to start. The narrator says that real-time AI controls hold vast potential.\n\nNext, the video shows a pie chart on a glass wall in the conference room, showing the breakdown of energy consumption. The narrator explains that the ODP (Open Digital Platform) can predict energy demand and propose adjustments, such as cooling spaces ahead of scheduled events. The video then shows a digital display showing the temperature and status of a VAV (variable air volume) system. The temperature decreases as the system cools down.\n\nThe video then shows two people walking into the conference room. The narrator says that elsewhere, delays at parking gantries are flagged immediately, boosting awareness and response times. The video shows a screen displaying video analytics from two cameras at a parking entrance. One camera shows a car that has exceeded the average time to clear the gantry.\n\nThe video then shows an aerial view of Singapore.

Passive design is the building block of the fundamental upon which we actually integrated our active design strategies. We have optimised our facade design, basically the building massing, the facade design such that there is less heat gain into the building. And we have actually optimised our window to wall ratio, the kind of the glass material so that we get enough daylight without bringing in additional glare. In terms of active design, this building may be one of the largest building in Singapore to adopt underfloor air distribution system, which is quite innovative and quite unique compared to a traditional overhead mixing system. This system brings in 15 to 20% more energy savings compared to traditional systems. And it is since it's a displacement cooling, the indoor air quality is better and also it provides better thermal comfort.

He is wearing glasses, a white shirt, and a dark blue blazer. He seems to be in his thirties or forties. He appears calm and confident while speaking. His facial expressions are serious and focused as he explains the building's design. He uses his hands to gesture as he speaks.\n\nThere are also various plants visible in the background, including trees and shrubs.","description":"Here is a description of the video in chronological order:\n\nThe video opens with a shot of the interior of a modern building. The camera pans across a large open space with people walking through it. Text on the screen reads, \u201cThe SJ Campus integrates passive and active design as well as smart building initiatives in its design. We have incorporated various passive, active and smart initiatives.\u201d\n\nNext, the camera angle shifts to an interior view looking up through a curved window. The window shows the interior of the building's atrium, which has a lot of greenery. Text on the screen reads, \u201cPassive design is the building block of the fundamental.\u201d\n\nA man in a business suit and glasses appears in the video. He is standing in a lush green atrium. He explains that passive design is the foundation upon which active design strategies are integrated. He states that the building\u2019s facade design was optimized to reduce heat gain. The window-to-wall ratio was also optimized, and the type of glass used allows for sufficient daylight without excessive glare.\n\nThe camera shows a view of the building\u2019s exterior, highlighting its unique design and the use of glass.\n\nThe man continues to speak, explaining that the SJ Campus is one of the largest buildings in Singapore to adopt an underfloor air distribution system. A close-up shot shows a vent in the floor. He says this system is innovative and unique compared to traditional overhead mixing systems. It provides 15\u201320% more energy savings and better air quality. Because it is a displacement cooling system, it also offers better indoor air quality and thermal comfort.\n\nThe man then discusses other active strategies, including smart lighting controls and smart facility management strategies.

When we started uh the design for the campus, so we know this particular part of Singapore is quite green and quite lush. We didn't want it to bring a building mass and intimidate the whole nature around it. So the idea was to have a seamless integration to the existing Jurong Eco-Garden. That's why the garden that I'm standing here is a natural extension of the Jurong Eco-Garden we have. We have actually achieved 100 percent green replacement for this project.

Arrows indicate air flowing into and out of the building. Text on the screen reads, \u201cNATURAL VENTILATION. Natural ventilation keeps selected areas cool without the need for air-conditioning.\u201d\n\nNext, an aerial view of a city is shown.  A section of the city is highlighted, and the text \u201cSolar Panel\u201d appears, pointing to the solar panels on the rooftops of the buildings in that section.  The narration explains that clean energy is supplied through a smart grid with solar panels on the rooftops, powering the district\u2019s energy needs.  The video then shows a close-up of a hand resting on a solar panel, with a blue grid overlay.\n\nThe video then shows an animation of a building with many sensors on its exterior. The text on the screen reads, \u201cSMART SENSORS TO ENABLE ENERGY OPTIMISATION.\u201d The narration explains that smart sensors and energy-efficient equipment are connected and integrated with the Open Digital Platform (ODP).  The video then shows two people working at a control panel with several screens displaying data, including a table of door locations and statuses, and graphs showing energy utilization. The narration explains that the system automatically adjusts indoor conditions according to the environment, achieving 60% energy savings through AI (Artificial Intelligence) and Machine Learning.  The video then shows a series of shots of the interior of the building, including the ceiling lights turning on and off, and then displays graphs showing weekly energy saved (15.22 kWh, 42.76 kWh, and 47.21 kWh) and overall energy savings.\n\nThe video then shows an aerial view of the city again, with a blue line highlighting a district cooling system. The narration explains that an efficient district cooling system with a four-kilometer underground pipe network cools all buildings in the district.  An animation of a building with a pipe connected to it is shown, and the text \u201cDISTRICT COOLING SYSTEM REDUCES 3,700 TONNES OF CARBON EMISSIONS PER YEAR\u201d appears on the screen.  A screen capture of a digital map of the pipe network is shown, with temperature readings for various locations.\n\nThe video then shows a person adding organic waste to a compost bin. The narration explains that at Punggol Digital District, food and horticultural waste are recycled into fertilizer, reducing three tonnes of waste per day.  The video shows hands holding a sample of the resulting fertilizer.\n\nFinally, the video shows another aerial view of the city, with a yellow line highlighting a pneumatic waste conveyance system.

They appear to be wearing gray sweatpants and white sneakers. They are carrying three reusable shopping bags; one green, one yellow, and one blue. The person seems to be walking at a normal pace and shows no particular emotion.\n\nFrom [00:00:18]\u2013[00:00:30], there are multiple people shown walking in a park-like setting at night. They are blurry and hard to make out, but they appear to be casually walking and talking with each other.","description":"Here is a description of the video in chronological order:\n\nThe video opens with an animation of a wireframe building. A blue line extends from the building to a blue box, which is labeled \u201cPneumatic Waste Conveyance System.\u201d The narrator explains that the system monitors waste collection and transfers it underground, creating a better working environment.\n\nNext, the video shows a person walking down a cobblestone street carrying three reusable shopping bags.\n\nThe animation of the wireframe building reappears. This time, a blue line extends from the building to a blue pool of water. The text \u201cRainwater Harvesting\u201d and \u201cReduction in Reliance on Potable Water\u201d appear on the screen. The narrator explains that rainwater is filtered through rain gardens and eco-ponds and collected to irrigate green spaces.\n\nThe video then shows footage of a pond with aquatic plants, a close-up of a drip irrigation system watering a plant, and an animation of a modern building with green spaces and people walking around.\n\nThe narrator explains that through sustainable design, energy
