      "* **Smart Technology Integration:**  The  district utilizes data to optimize living and working spaces, including energy management (demonstrated by a system that suggests switching off lights and AC, and graphs showing energy savings ), waste management (a pneumatic waste conveyance system), and air quality monitoring.  A digital platform monitors and manages electrical, cooling, and waste systems, allowing for  real-time resource optimization.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Sustainable Design:**  The project incorporates sustainable practices such as rainwater harvesting for irrigation, and building orientation to utilize natural winds and reduce energy consumption from air conditioning.  The goal is a net-zero  future.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Community Focus:**  The design emphasizes community building, fostering interaction between companies and attracting talent.  Amenities such as a hawker centre, childcare centres, and a community club are included to support a live-work- learn-play lifestyle.  The masterplan includes significant green spaces.\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Infrastructure:**  The district is well-connected to the rest of Singapore via expressways, an integrated bus interchange, and the future Punggol Coast MRT station.  Its proximity to existing amenities and transportation hubs is also emphasized.\n",
